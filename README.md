# Visual Coding Lesson

Use the Allen Brain Observatory Visual Coding dataset to compute tuning curves of neurons in the mouse visual cortex. This capsule has multiple lessons to compute tuning curves and compare responses of different neurons in the cortex.

This capsule has three notebooks. 

1. Compute tuning curve. This notebook walks through how to compute the tuning curve of a neuron to the Drifting Gratings stimulus.

2. Compare neurons. This notebook uses what was done in notebook 1 to compute tuning curves for a variety of neurons in order to compare the types of responses we find in the mouse primary visual cortex.

3. Correlations. This is a short notebook to compute the correlations between a pair of neurons, showing how the correlations change depending on what aspect of the neurons activity we compare. This is optional.

The capsule assumes students have some familiarity with python. Specifically students are expected to be familiar with:
- for loops
- enumerate
- numpy: creating and working with arrays
- pandas: simple dataframe functions
- matplotlib: plot, imshow, labeling axes (errorbars, axvspan, axhline are also used, but are demonstrated in the notebooks)
